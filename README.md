This is the first project during Wild Code School Web Dev Bootcamp.
The goal is to build a simple web app using vanilla js.

# Features

1. User can browse through a list of recommendations and filter  based on their preferred categories (e.g “beach”,  “dog-friendly” ).

2. User can sort the trips according to rating, travel cost and travel time.
